An initiative from the Open Threat Research (OTR) community to share cloud templates and scripts to deploy network environments to simulate adversaries, generate data and learn more about adversary tradecraft from a defensive perspective. The difference with other environments is that we do not have one scenario to cover all use-cases, but multiple modular environments that adapt to specific topics of research. 

Think of this repository as the library of emulation/emulation plans but from an infrastructure perspective üèóÔ∏è

We started by sharing ATT&CK evaluations environment templates with the commuinity (i.e [APT29 Scenario](https://github.com/OTRF/mordor-labs/tree/master/environments/attack-evals/apt29)). Now we are expanding our scope and building more templates for other projects such as:

* [Center for Threat Informed Defense - Adversary Emulation Library](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/adversary_emulation_library)
    * ATT&CK Evaluations
* [RhinoSecurityLabs - CloudGoat](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/cloudgoat)

Finally, we do not only create these environments for someone to follow an attack path and execute it, but also to collect and share telemetry. Every environment built under the project `SimuLand` has a data pipeline to export the data collected during the simulation and share it with the community officially through the [Mordor Project](https://github.com/OTRF/mordor).
